# BetMind AI

## Introduction
In the dynamic world of sports betting, staying ahead of the game requires innovative solutions. BetMind AI emerges as a groundbreaking project, employing cutting-edge technology to provide accurate sports predictions.

### ⚠️The project is not yet complete, so I won't be able to show the code publicly. However, if you have any further questions, I'd be happy to explain the concept of the project in more detail.⚠️

## Features

### 1. Web Scraping
Utilizing Python, Beautiful Soup (BS4), and Pandas, BetMind AI pioneers the use of web scraping techniques. The project extracts valuable data from both football statistics websites and sports betting platforms to gather a comprehensive datasbase. This includes intricate details on player performance, team statistics, and odds from betting platforms.

### 2. Data Organization and Storage
The acquired data is structured and organized into .csv files, creating an efficient and manageable format. BetMind AI then takes a step further by transferring this information to a SQLite database. This ensures a secure and centralized repository for all relevant data, facilitating quick retrieval and analysis.

### 3. Intelligent Cross-Referencing
The project involves the creation of a statistical method. This method intelligently cross-references information between the SQLite database and proprietary algorithms. 

### 4. Telegram Bot Integration
The pinnacle of BetMind AI is the development of a Telegram bot. The bot integrates with the statistical method, providing users with real-time insights, suggested bets, and probability assessments.
